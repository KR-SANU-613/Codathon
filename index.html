        <h1 class="txt3">Young businesses have an unproven track record</h1>
        <h2 class="txt4">The early stages of our business are some of the toughest, as we try to build a loyal customer base and establish our reputation. It takes time to build trust, and new businesses are starting from square one. Plus, a good reputation is especially precarious in the early stages of your business. That means we have to exceed expectations numerous times to gain a reputation as a trustworthy and consistent business. </h2>

    <div class="box4">
        <h1 class="txt5">Mistakes are inevitable</h1>
        <h2 class="txt6">Handling your mistakes with grace is key to maintaining trust. No matter how much we educate ourself and our employees, mistakes will eventually happen. Therefore, it’s equally important for businesses to devote time to the education necessary to preventing mistakes as it is to developing a plan of action for responding when they occur. What truly matters is whether we acknowledge our mistakes and work hard to regain whatever trust you may have lost. </h2>

        <h1 class="txt8">Acknowledge inactive customers</h1>
        <h2 class="txt9">No matter what the company sells, we should try to regularly assess customer engagement and activity levels. For example, if wesell software—try to interpret usage patterns. Does customer activity often slow three months before cancellation? Metrics like this can help us pinpoint which customers are most at risk of cancelling. That way, we can prevent loss of trust before it even happens.</h2>

        <h2 class="txt10">Be reachable</h2>
        <h2 class="txt11">When a customer contacts us with an issue with our product or service, it's in our best interest to have a support rep in touch with them as quickly as possible.our service reps need to be as composed and professional as possible — no matter how agitated a customer might be.Providing them with readily accessible, exemplary customer service will show them that we value their business well beyond their initial purchase. If customers know we care, they'll be more inclined to trust us.</h2>

    <h2 class="txt12">Go all-out for customer <br>service</h2>
    <h2 class="txt13">Trust becomes fragile when customers have an issue with something. If they experience a problem and receive prompt, helpful and memorable customer service, they'll think of you forever as a reliable brand.
        But if you drop the ball, you'll lose a customer forever and likely experience a dip in your reputation. Whenever you can, go all-out in your customer service. Don't just turn to the most cost-efficient way to resolve a problem; make sure your customers feel heard and appreciated, and go out of your way to make them happy.</h2>

  <div class="box9">
    <h2 class="txt14">Deliver on Your promises</h2>
    <h2 class="txt15">The most trustworthy brands are those that deliver on their promises. When a customer is promised a callback at a certain time, a delivery on a certain date, or a promotional offer, always follow through. This is especially important if a service case is taking a long time to resolve, as the customer will need to stay informed as the solution is being sought. Never keep our customers guessing if you will follow through with a promise. Instead, surpass their expectations by offering even more than initially promised, such as shipping a product sooner or offering a special discount to thank customers for their loyalty.</h2>
